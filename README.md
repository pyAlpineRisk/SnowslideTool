<u>QGIS-SnowslideTool: GIS-supported range determination of snowslide processes (flat-rate slope method)</u>
</p>

<p>The QGIS-SnowslideTool uses high-resolution terrain models and GIS techniques to automatically calculate and display precise slope and range estimates in the terrain. It improves the assessment of potential natural hazards and reduces the amount of manual work involved. The tool is particularly suitable for mapping areas of snowslides in areas below 1500 m above sea level. It automatically determines flow paths and slope direction lines and visualizes them within the QGIS project. The automated terrain analysis with the QGIS-SnowslideTool is a promising approach for precise and efficient data analysis and interpretation from remote sensing data.</p>
